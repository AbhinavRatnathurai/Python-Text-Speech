Commanding: 

Winston Churchill is an example of a commanding leader. Churchill was especially known as a powerful orator and man overall, and often was able to inspire others to action simply via his commanding speeches and viewpoint.


Visionary:
Martin Luther King Jr. was a visionary. He was a man who had a dream bigger than the times in which he lived. That is, after all, what real visionary leaders are all about. His "I Have a Dream" speech brought awareness and humanity to the national consciousness about civil rights in America.
